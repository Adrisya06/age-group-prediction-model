The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a nationally representative health study conducted by the CDCâ€™s National Center for Health Statistics which uniquely combines interviews, physical exams, and lab tests to assess the health and nutritional status of U.S. children and adults. 
This dataset is a subset, focused part of the NHANES study by CDC, which looks at health and nutrition trends in the U.S. It has 6,287 entries and 7 key features: covering things like body stats, lifestyle, and lab results. The model predicts if a person is a senior (65+) or not.
